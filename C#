Q3. What is Trigger,Store procedure, join in sql query and their syntax
Ans. A trigger is a database object that is automatically executed in response to certain events. A stored procedure is a named group of SQL statements that can be executed. A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
Triggers are used to enforce business rules, perform data validation, or automate tasks.

Stored procedures are used to encapsulate a set of SQL statements for reuse and better performance.

Joins are used to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a related column.

Syntax examples: TRIGGER trigger_name {BEFORE | AFTER} {INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE} ON table_name FOR EACH ROW BEGIN ... END;

Syntax examples: CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name [parameters] AS BEGIN ... END;

Syntax examples: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Q6. What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces? When would you choose one over the other, and why?
Ans. Abstract class is used when there is a need for default implementation, while interfaces are used for multiple inheritance.
Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while interfaces can only have abstract methods.

Abstract classes can provide default implementations for methods, while interfaces cannot.

Interfaces allow a class to implement multiple interfaces, but can only inherit from one abstract class.

Use abstract classes when there is a need for a common base implementation, and interfaces when multiple inheritance is required.

Q7. Is it possible to have two primary keys in an SQL table?
Ans. No, only one primary key can be defined in a SQL table.
Primary key ensures uniqueness of each record in a table.

A table can have only one primary key constraint.

However, a composite primary key can be created using multiple columns.

Q8. What are JOINs in SQL, and what is the difference between Inner JOIN and Equi JOIN? Illustrate with an example.
Ans. JOINS are used in SQL to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
Inner JOIN returns only the matching rows from both tables

Equi JOIN is a type of Inner JOIN where the join condition is based on equality between two columns

Q9. If you have a static constructor and a default constructor, which gets executed first?
Ans. Static constructor gets executed first before default constructor.
Static constructor is called only once, when the class is first accessed or instantiated.

Default constructor is called every time a new instance of the class is created.

Example: If a class has both static and default constructors, the static constructor will be executed before the default constructor.

Q10. what is filter? How to add custom filter? How to configure middleware?
Ans. Filters are used to manipulate incoming and outgoing requests. Custom filters can be added and middleware can be configured to handle them.
Filters are used to modify or validate incoming and outgoing requests in ASP.NET Core.

Custom filters can be added by creating a class that implements IFilterMetadata interface.

Middleware can be configured to handle filters using the UseFilter extension method.

Filters can be used for authentication, caching, logging, and more.

Filters can be global, controller-level, or action-level.

Q11. If you have a class with a private variable, can you use that class in another class?
Ans. Yes, by using access modifiers like public or internal.
Yes, by changing the access modifier of the class to public or internal.

Private variables can be accessed within the same class but not outside. Use properties or methods to access them in other classes.

Example: class A has a private variable 'x'. In class B, create an instance of class A and access 'x' using a public method or property.

Q16. What is oops? Oops is a object oriented programing system
Ans. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data.
OOP focuses on creating reusable code by organizing data and behavior into objects.

It emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Objects have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that can interact with each other.

Example: In C#, classes are used to define objects and their properties and methods.

Q22. What is Encapsulation? How do you hide data using Encapsulation?
Ans. Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit.
Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and restricting access to it.

Data hiding is achieved by making the variables private and providing public methods to access or modify them.

For example, a class 'Car' may have private variables like 'model' and 'year' with public methods like 'getModel()' and 'setYear()' to access or modify them.
